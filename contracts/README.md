# OptimalAI: AI-Powered DeFi Portfolio Manager

**OptimalAI** is a comprehensive DeFi portfolio management system that leverages artificial intelligence to optimize investments across multiple protocols. The system consists of a modular smart contract architecture that enables secure asset management, automated trading strategies, and cross-protocol interactions. Built for the Safe Agentathon, OptimalAI aims to redefine DeFi portfolio management by combining AI-driven decision-making with robust on-chain execution.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

OptimalAI is built on a modular architecture, with the following key components:

### 1. **SafeVaultDeployer**

- Factory contract for deploying user vaults
- Maintains registry of vault ownership
- Handles network-specific configurations
- Manages protocol integrations

### 2. **SafeVault**

- Core user interaction contract
- Inherits ProtocolHelper functionality
- Manages deposits, withdrawals, and investments
- Tracks investment positions through Investment struct:

```javascript
struct Investment {
    address tokenAddress;
    uint256 balanceUnderlying;
    uint256 balanceInvestedInAave;
    uint256 balanceInvestedInCompound;
    uint256 balanceInvestedInUniswap;
}
```

### 3. **ProtocolHelper**

- Protocol interaction layer
- Implements standardized interfaces for:
  - Aave V3 lending operations
  - Compound V3 deposit management
  - Uniswap V3 liquidity and swap operations
- Manages protocol-specific balance tracking

### 4. **OptimalArbitrage**

- Flash loan-based arbitrage execution
- Integrates with Balancer V2 for flash loans
- Implements cross-protocol swap logic
- Optimizes for profitable trading opportunities

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Protocol Integration**

```javascript
contract ProtocolHelper {
    IPool public aaveLiquidityPool;
    CometMainInterface public cUSDC;
    ISwapRouter public immutable uniswapSwapRouter;
    IUniswapV3Factory public immutable uniswapPoolFactory;
    INonfungiblePositionManager public immutable nonfungiblePositionManager;
}
```

### **Investment Management**

```javascript
mapping(address => Investment) public tokenAddressToInvestmentStruct;
mapping(address => bool) public isWhitelisted;
```

### **Arbitrage Execution**

```javascript
struct ArbitrageTrade {
    address[] dexRouters;
    address[] tokens;
    uint24 swapFee;
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Foundry**: Install Foundry for smart contract development and testing.
   ```bash
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   foundryup
   ```

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Riiz0/OptimalAI.git
   cd OptimalAI
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   forge install
   ```

3. Compile the smart contract:

   ```bash
